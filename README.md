## Installation

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:viktopia/notipus.git
cd notipus
```

2. Build the Docker Image
Build the necessary Docker containers for the project:
```
docker-compose build
```

3. Set Environment Variables
The application reads configuration from environment variables. Set these before running:
```bash
export SECRET_DJANGO_KEY=your-secure-secret-key-here
export DEBUG=True

# Notipus billing (for subscription revenue)
export NOTIPUS_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_key
export NOTIPUS_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Optional: Override other settings
export DB_PASSWORD=secure_db_password
```
Note: Webhook secrets for customer integrations are now managed per-tenant through the web interface.

4. Run the Containers
Start the Docker containers with the specified environment variables:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode.

5. Verify the Setup
Ensure that the services are running correctly by checking the Docker container logs:
```
docker-compose logs -f
```
Access the application based on the configured settings (e.g., http://localhost:8000).

6. Stopping the Containers
To stop the running containers, use:
```
docker-compose down
```

## Configuration

### Core Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

**Required for production:**
- `SECRET_DJANGO_KEY`: Django secret key for cryptographic operations
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password for PostgreSQL

**Notipus billing (subscription revenue):**
- `NOTIPUS_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe secret key for processing subscriptions
- `NOTIPUS_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Webhook secret for Stripe billing events

**Optional overrides:**
- `DEBUG`: Set to "False" for production (defaults to "True")
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of allowed hostnames
- `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_HOST`: Database connection parameters

### Per-Tenant Configuration

Customer webhook integrations (Shopify, Chargify, Stripe) are configured per-tenant through the web interface. Each organization manages their own:
- Webhook secrets
- API credentials
- Slack integration settings
