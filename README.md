### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:viktopia/notipus.git
cd notipus
```

2. Build the Docker Image
Build the necessary Docker containers for the project:
```
docker-compose build
```

3. Create the .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory to store environment variables. Below is a template for reference:

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/test
CHARGIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=test_secret
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=test_secret
SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL=test.myshopify.com

Note: Replace the placeholder values (test_secret, test_token, etc.) with the actual credentials and secrets for your environment.

4. Run the Containers
Start the Docker containers with the specified environment variables:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode.

5. Verify the Setup

```
docker-compose logs -f
```
Access the application based on the configured settings (e.g., http://localhost:8000).

6. Stopping the Containers
To stop the running containers, use:
